# Footy

A simple application that provides up-to-date statistics, game schedules, trade rumors, and media of your favorite footy teams

## Description 

Footy is a futbol application that allows users to search for their local favorite teams in order to get live updates, game schedules, trade rumors, and team statistics. The application provides users with additional information in the form of a carousel that contains top futbol news, as well as an option to view recent highlight videos and gifs of the user's team of choice. The purpose behind Footy is simple. Futbol is the world's most popular sport, and one of the fastest growing sports within the United States. The game is universal, bringing together individuals from every different kind of background, ethnicity, religion, and creed. Because of this, Footy is the perfect environment for new fans and existing fanatics to get together and explore the sport in an informational, entertaining way. 

Footy is created mainly through JavaScript/JQuery using dynamic html that loads with the page. The grid system and minor styling were made through Foundation, while many of the unique elements of the site were modified using custom CSS3. 

Future plans to the project include adding a player search, finding and API and integrating women's team/player search, and customization of the page's CSS in order to match a user's favorite team.

# FootyMania
## Description
For this project me and 3 other team members were tasked with bringing an application idea to life. Prior to the actual build of the application, the project team members collaborated to create a user story and we expressed what motivated us to develop this type of application; the motivation came from the love of the sport Futbal and wanting to bring more people toegther through the sport. The team also created an elevator pitch to show the value and importance of the FootyMania application. One challenge was the team couldn't use BootStrap as a framework, we used Foundation as an alternative. The challenge is due to the fact the entire team is comfortable and experienced in BootStrap, where as when it came to Foundation we had no experience at all. One team member incorporated real time data at the top of the page by adding a marquee.js file. He implemented the marquee through a plugin and the team only needed to call the createMarquee() function. In addition to the marquee.js file a marquee.css file was created also to include custom styling for the marquee. Within the main.js file the team implemented several  API calls using AJAX. The APIs we utilized were https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/free-football-soccer-videos1, https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-football, and https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/. It was important the APIs included a video of the team that was searched, also it needed to include stattistics and a GIF. A lot of functions were needed also for our page to work and have the key features we envisioned.
