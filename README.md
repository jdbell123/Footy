# Footy

A simple application that provides up-to-date statistics, game schedules, trade rumors, and media of your favorite footy teams

## Description 

Footy is a futbol application that allows users to search for their local favorite teams in order to get live updates, game schedules, trade rumors, and team statistics. The application provides users with additional information in the form of a carousel that contains top futbol news, as well as an option to view recent highlight videos and gifs of the user's team of choice. The purpose behind Footy is simple. Futbol is the world's most popular sport, and one of the fastest growing sports within the United States. The game is universal, bringing together individuals from every different kind of background, ethnicity, religion, and creed. Because of this, Footy is the perfect environment for new fans and existing fanatics to get together and explore the sport in an informational, entertaining way. 

Footy is created mainly through JavaScript/JQuery using dynamic html that loads with the page. The grid system and minor styling were made through Foundation, while many of the unique elements of the site were modified using custom CSS3. 

Future plans to the project include adding a player search, finding and API and integrating women's team/player search, and customization of the page's CSS in order to match a user's favorite team.
